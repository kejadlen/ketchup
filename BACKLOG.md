### Colorscheme

**What:** A cohesive color palette instead of ad-hoc hex values.
**Why now:** The app is visually usable but the colors are arbitrary.
**Done when:**
- Colors are defined as CSS custom properties
- Applied consistently across the app

## Icebox

- Delete a series
- Fixed-schedule recurrence (e.g., "every Monday" vs "7 days after completion")
- Shared tasks — visible to all users, anyone can mark done
- CLI interface
