## Backlog

### Colorscheme

**What:** A cohesive color palette instead of ad-hoc hex values.
**Why now:** The app is visually usable but the colors are arbitrary.
**Done when:**
- Colors are defined as CSS custom properties
- Applied consistently across the app

## Icebox

- Delete a series
- Fixed-schedule recurrence (e.g., "every Monday" vs "7 days after completion")
- Shared tasks — visible to all users, anyone can mark done
- CLI interface
- Don't re-download baseline for snapshots unnecessarily
- Dark mode
- Add snapshots of more states to check (adding notes, etc.)
- Cuprite (Capybara) instead of Ferrum?
- Make snapshots embiggen images on click
- Steep
- Fix pages triggering from release
- Improve the diff page to highlight differences
- Status endpoint with debug information
